/**
A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
 (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)

should become:

10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
 (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)

The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

The data is given in an array as such:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

Note: In the C and NASM languages you are given the third parameter which is the number of segment blocks.

const dataReverse = data => 
	data.reduce((accum, currItem, currIndex) => {
		return currIndex % 8 == 0 && currIndex != 0 ? accum + ' ' + currItem : accum + currItem;
	}, '').split(' ').reverse().join('').split('').map(elem => Number(elem));

console.log(dataReverse([1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]));
