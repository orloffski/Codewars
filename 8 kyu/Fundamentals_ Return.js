/**
Make multiple functions that will return the sum, difference, modulus, product, quotient, and the exponent respectively.

Please use the following function names:

addition = add

multiply = multiply

division = divide (both integer and float divisions are accepted)

modulus = mod

exponential = exponent

subtraction = subt

Note: All math operations will be: a (operation) b

add = (a,b) => a + b

divide = (a,b) => a / b

multiply = (a,b) => a * b

mod = (a,b) => a % b
   
exponent = (a,b) => a ** b
    
subt = (a,b) => a - b

console.log(mod(21, 98));
